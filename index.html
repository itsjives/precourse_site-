						<h2> About Me </h2>
							<p>Hello everyone! My name is Johnny Capra and I am originally from Scottsdale, Arizona.  I went to The University of Arizona for my undergrad degree, which is a Bachelor of Science in Psychology.  Once I graduated I moved to Lake Tahoe, to snowboard competitively, work, and enjoy the lake and outdoors with friends.  After, getting myself injured a couple times I moved to the bay area to work in sales and property management.  It was great being closer to my college friends.  I have lots of hobbies: creating music, listening to music, snowboarding, hiking, hanging with friends, traveling when I can, making websites (once I'm good at it) and of course messing around with photoshop from time to time. </p>

				<h2> Whats Next </h2>
						<p>After working in sales, and continuing my success I decided I wanted to learn more skills.  I've always enjoyed computers, so I figured I should give web development a try.  I've learned a little python and a little javascript and now I'm here at galvanize to further learn and develope this new skill set.  My goals are to work for a company professionally creating / working on websites, maybe get a masters degree, but we'll see.  My education goals are to learn how to properly use API's, learn how to use sockets or whatever allows me use my iphone gyroscope abilites to control the movement of the javascript game, while playing it on the laptop screen, learn e-commerce and database building, get really good at CRUD as well, and making chat rooms, stuff like that. Thats pretty much everything I can think of for my hopes and dreams as of now. </p>
